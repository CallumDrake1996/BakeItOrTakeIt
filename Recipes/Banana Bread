method - 

STEP 1
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

STEP 2
Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.

STEP 3
Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly add 2 beaten large eggs with a little of the 140g flour.

STEP 4
Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.

STEP 5
Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 mins, or until cooked through. Check the loaf at 5-min intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and removed cleanly), as the time may vary depending on the shape of your loaf tin.

STEP 6
Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack.

STEP 7
Mix 50g icing sugar with 2-3 tsp water to make a runny icing.

STEP 8
Drizzle the icing across the top of the cake and decorate with a handful of banana chips.
